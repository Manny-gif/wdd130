        [Victoria Falls, one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World, is Zambia's crown jewel and a must-visit destination for any traveler. 
        Known locally as Mosi-oa-Tunya—“The Smoke That Thunders”—this breathtaking waterfall plunges over 100 meters into the Zambezi River, 
        creating a spectacular mist and a roaring sound that can be heard from miles away.
        Visitors can witness the falls from multiple viewpoints, take a thrilling dip in the Devil's Pool at the edge of the cascade, 
        or embark on an unforgettable sunset cruise along the Zambezi River. Adventure seekers can experience the ultimate adrenaline rush with bungee jumping, white-water rafting, and microlight flights over the falls]

        [ Lower Zambezi National Park is a haven for diverse and abundant wildlife, 
        offering some of the best game-viewing experiences in Africa. 
        The park is home to large herds of elephants, often seen gathering along the Zambezi River, as well as buffalo, zebras, and impalas grazing on the floodplains. Predators such as lions, leopards, 
        and hyenas roam the park, while the elusive African wild dog occasionally makes an appearance.
        The Zambezi River itself is teeming with hippos and crocodiles, providing spectacular sightings, especially during boat safaris. 
        The park is also a paradise for bird lovers, with over 400 bird species, including fish eagles, kingfishers, and the vibrant carmine bee-eaters]
